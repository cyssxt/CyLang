# CyLang
A language for json parse which contains params or expression

# Introduce
###### Now when we start develop a RESTful api or JsonRpc,we often use json as a data type,because it's easy to unstand and simple to right! 
###### When we post or get from a url,we also use json to package params!So I think we need a language to parse params or express in json param.
###### If that ,we can use params to get value from system or databases,or others.

# 1„ÄÅMain idea
